"Titan needs to determine each visitor’s IP address to provide security "
"functions on your website. The Titan default configuration works just fine "
"for most websites, but it’s important that this configuration is correct. "
"For example, if Titan is not receiving IP addresses correctly and thinks an "
"external visitor originates from a private address, it will whitelist that "
"visitor and bypass security protocols. You can read more about which "
"addresses Titan considers private here.\n"
"\n"
"The Titan scanner has an option to “Scan for misconfigured How does Titan "
"get IPs”. This scan feature can help you detect if the wrong option has been "
"selected for “How does Titan get IPs.”\n"
"\n"
"Another way of determining if Titan is getting IPs correctly is to check the "
"“IPs” section in the Titan Tools > Diagnostics.\n"
"\n"
"Let Titan use the most secure method to get visitor IP addresses. Prevents "
"spoofing and works with most sites.\n"
"This is the default mode of operation for Titan. Titan will try to get a "
"valid IP address from PHP and if that doesn’t work, it will look at data "
"that a firewall or reverse proxy sends in case your website uses this "
"configuration.\n"
"\n"
"This option provides a good balance between security and compatibility.\n"
"\n"
"Use PHP’s built in REMOTE_ADDR and don’t use anything else. Very secure if "
"this is compatible with your site.\n"
"If you know that you definitely don’t use a reverse proxy, cache, Cloudflare,"
" CDN or anything else in front of your web server that “proxies” traffic to "
"your website, and if you are sure that your website is just a standalone PHP "
"web server, then using this option will work and is the most secure in a non-"
"proxy or load balancer configuration.\n"
"\n"
"You may also want to select this option for other reasons – for example to "
"force Titan to use the $_SERVER[‘REMOTE_ADDR’] variable in PHP.\n"
"\n"
"Use the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header. Only use if you have a front-end proxy "
"or spoofing may result.\n"
"If you are using Nginx or another load balancer as a front-end-proxy or load "
"balancer in front of your web server, and the front-end server sends IP "
"addresses to the web server that runs WordPress using the HTTP X-Forwarded-"
"For header, then you should enable this option.\n"
"\n"
"Be careful about enabling this option if you do not have a front-end-proxy, "
"load balancer, or CDN configuration, because it will then allow visitors to "
"spoof their IP address and you will also miss many hits that should have "
"been logged.\n"
"\n"
"Use the X-Real-IP HTTP header. Only use if you have a front-end proxy or "
"spoofing may result.\n"
"As with the X-Forwarded-For option above, only use this option if you are "
"sure that you want Titan to retrieve the visitor IP address from the X-Real-"
"IP HTTP header, and do not enable this if you don’t have a front-end proxy "
"or load balancer that is sending visits to your real web server and adding "
"the X-Real-IP header.\n"
"\n"
"Use the Cloudflare “CF-Connecting-IP” HTTP header to get a visitor IP. Only "
"use if you’re using Cloudflare.\n"
"Titan is fully compatible with CloudFlare, and in some configurations "
"Cloudflare will send the real visitor IP address to your web server using "
"the CF-Connecting-IP HTTP header. If the CloudFlare support personnel have "
"advised you that this is the case, then enable this option on Titan to "
"ensure that Titan is able to get your visitor IP address.\n"
"\n"
"Note that Cloudflare has several configurations including their own web "
"server module that takes care of detecting the visitor IP address, so be "
"sure to work with their technical support staff and read their documentation "
"to determine which configuration you’re using.\n"
"\n"
"Multiple IPs detected\n"
"If your host requires using the X-Forwarded-For header, there may be "
"multiple IP addresses detected. If your own IP address does not appear where "
"it shows “Your IP with this setting,” you may need to add trusted proxies.\n"
"\n"
"If you do not know whether your host uses more than one proxy address, "
"contact your host or the reverse-proxy service that you use. If you know "
"there is only one proxy address, it should be the last address in the "
"“Detected IPs” field.\n"
"\n"
"Once you know which proxies to trust, click the + Edit trusted proxies link "
"below the detected IPs.\n"
"In the Trusted proxies field that appears, enter the IP addresses of the "
"proxies. You can enter a single IP like 10.0.0.15. You can also enter a "
"“CIDR” range like 10.0.0.0/24. Note that your host’s trusted IPs should not "

"If you are having a problem with people stealing your content and pretending "

"reports of it blocking real site visitors, especially (for some reason) "
"legitimate visitors from Brazil. It’s possible, although we haven’t "
"confirmed this, that some Internet service providers in Brazil use "
"transparent proxies that  modify their customers’ user-agent headers to "
