Anti-spam, Site Security Check & Malware Scanner.

== Description ==
Titan includes anti-spam, firewall, malware scanner, site accessibility checking, security and threats audits for WordPress websites. Our security functions provide Titan with the latest firewall rules, malware signatures, and database of malicious IP addresses - all you need to ensure the security of your website.

Titan is a comprehensive WordPress security solution, completed by a set of additional features as add-ons, which was placed into a simple and intuitive interface.

**Why did we update Anti-Spam and what is Titan?**

Let me tell you before we start: your favorite Anti-Spam had not disappeared! Instead of that it revived and became stronger to stand guard over the secure of your site!
The latest update of Anti-Spam is called Titan Anti-spam & Security and represents the brand new version of a plugin.

**Why TITAN?**

We aim to create a plugin as reliable as this metal - and easy-to-use at the same time. The new name of our plugin sets the pace with newest and highest standards of quality.

What has been changed except the name?
Whilst the process of modernization we had to take some complicated decisions. One of them was:
What should we do: keep Anti-Spam like a simple plugin with the only one function or complicate it with a huge complex of tools made for the security of your site?
Constant feedback from users and versatile development experience lets us claim that the situation when there is too many tools couldn’t exist!
We considered all possibilities thoroughly to secure the best future for the plugin.
Let me introduce new secure functionality that was developed with spending a lot of time, effort and consideration:

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to test what spam comments were blocked? =

You can visit Anti-spam settings page and enable saving blocked comments as spam in the spam section.
To enabled that you need to go to: WordPress admin dashboard => Settings section => Anti-spam
Saving blocked comments into spam section is disabled by default.
Saving spam comments can help you to keep all the comments saved and review them in future if needed. You can easily mark comment as "not spam" if some of the comments were blocked by mistake.

= What is the percentage of spam blocked? =

Anti-spam plugin blocks 100% of automatic spam messages (sent by spam-bots via post requests).
Plugin does not block manual spam (submitted by spammers manually via browser).

= Incompatible with: =

* Disqus
* Jetpack Comments
* AJAX Comment Form
* bbPress

= How does Anti-spam plugin work? =

The blocking algorithm is based on 2 methods: 'invisible js-captcha' and 'invisible input trap' (aka honeypot technique).

= How does 'invisible js-captcha' method (aka honeypot) work? =

The 'invisible js-captcha' method is based on fact that bots does not have javascript on their user-agents.
Extra hidden field is added to comments form.
It is the question about the current year.
If the user visits site, than this field is answered automatically with javascript, is hidden by javascript and css and invisible for the user.
If the spammer will fill year-field incorrectly - the comment will be blocked because it is spam.

= How does 'invisible input trap' (aka honeypot technique) method work? =

The 'invisible input trap' method is based on fact that almost all the bots will fill inputs with name 'email' or 'url'.
Extra hidden field is added to comments form.
This field is hidden for the user and user will not fill it.
But this field is visible for the spammer.
If the spammer will fill this trap-field with anything - the comment will be blocked because it is spam.

= How to know the counter of blocked spam comments? =

You can find the info block with total spam blocked counter in the admin comments section.
You can hide or show this info block in the "Screen Options" section.
The visibility option for this info block is saved per user.

= Does plugin block spam from Contact or other forms? =

Plugin blocks spam only in comments form section and does not block spam from any other forms on site.
If you installed and activated the plugin and you still receiving spam - probably this could be because of some other forms on your site (for example feedback form).

= What about trackback spam? =

Users rarely use trackbacks because it is manual and requires extra input. Spammers uses trackbacks because it is easy to cheat here.
Users use pingbacks very often because they work automatically. Spammers does not use pingbacks because backlinks are checked.
So trackbacks are blocked but pingbacks are enabled.

= What browsers are supported? =

All modern browsers and IE8+ are supported.

= Unobtrusive JavaScript =

Anti-spam plugin works with disabled JavaScript. JavaScript is disabled on less than 1% of devices.
Users with disabled JavaScript should manually fill catcha-like input before submitting the comment.

= And one more extra note... =

If site has caching plugin enabled and cache is not cleared or if theme does not use 'comment_form' action
and there is no plugin inputs in comments form - plugin tries to add hidden fields automatically using JavaScript.

= Not enough information about the plugin? =
two
You may check out the [source code of the plugin](http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/anti-spam/trunk/anti-spam.php).
The plugin is pretty small and easy to read.
